When you select PoyoEx, you can use the following functions from the sub-menu.

- **ExBody_Toggle**
  ExBody is OFF by default to prevent accidents.
  By turning ExBody_Toggle ON, the ExBody will be displayed.
- **Ex_V_Auto**
  When the Auto function is ON, the PhysBone in the private area turns ON, and you can interactively open and close the private area with your fingers.
  If it is set to OFF, it will not animate.
- **V_Open**
  Opens and closes the front of the private area without referencing PhysBone.
- **A_Open**
  Opens and closes the back of the private area without referencing PhysBone.
- **Well-used**
  The color of the private area changes to look well-used.
